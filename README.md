Project Title: The Social Media Break-Up: Psycho-Behavioral Measures and Implications

Description:
This project investigates the psycho-behavioral measures and implications related to social media discontinuation, particularly focusing on the phenomenon of "social media break-ups." In an increasingly interconnected world, understanding why users choose to disengage from social media platforms is crucial for both individuals and service providers.

The research integrates the "Stimulus-Organism-Response" (S-O-R) framework to explore the antecedents and effects of social media fatigue. A quantitative study was conducted, surveying 384 Facebook users selected through convenience sampling. The Smart-PLS technique and software were utilized for data analysis.

Key Findings:

Stimuli: Information overload, communication overload, social media self-efficacy, privacy concerns, social media helpfulness, and annoyance were identified as significant stimuli.
Organism (Mediating Factors): These stimuli increase feelings of fatigue, which are integrated with the perceived relevance of social media by users.
Response (Outcomes): Increased fatigue, in turn, leads to higher intentions of social media discontinuance and ad avoidance behavior.
Technical Stack:

Backend: Python (Django Framework)
Database: MySQL
Machine Learning Libraries:
pandas (for data manipulation)
scikit-learn (for various machine learning algorithms, including:
CountVectorizer for text feature extraction
Multinomial Naive Bayes
ExtraTreeClassifier
LinearSVC (SVM)
LogisticRegression
DecisionTreeClassifier
VotingClassifier for ensemble modeling)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (CanvasJS for charting)


Purpose and Impact:

This research provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to social media fatigue and discontinuation. The findings offer practical implications for marketers, entrepreneurs, and organizations in the ever-expanding Social Networking Services (SNS) market, helping them understand user behavior and mitigate issues related to social media usage and break-up. For individual users, it sheds light on the underlying reasons for their disengagement, potentially aiding in making informed decisions about their social media habits.
